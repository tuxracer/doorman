# Doorman 🔓📞

**Doorman** is an automated door unlock system for residents using a callbox. When someone presses your code at the callbox, it places a phone call. Normally, you answer and press a digit to unlock the door. Doorman automates this by answering the call and pressing the unlock digit when auto-unlock is enabled.

Perfect for deliveries 📦 or letting in guests without needing to pick up the phone. Toggle auto-unlock on or off through a simple web interface.

> ⚠️ **Note**: You must ask your property manager to configure the callbox to call your Twilio number instead of your personal phone.

## Features

- 🔑 Automatic door unlocking using DTMF tones
- 🌐 Web interface to enable or disable unlocking
- 📊 Activity tracking for unlocks, calls, and rejections
- 📱 SMS notifications when the door is unlocked (optional)
- 🛠️ Customizable behavior and timing

---

## How It Works

1. Your callbox is set up to call your Twilio number
2. Twilio forwards incoming calls to your `/api/answer` endpoint
3. Doorman auto-answers the call
4. If unlocking is enabled:
   - It waits a few seconds
   - Sends the unlock digit (e.g. `9`)
   - Hangs up after a short delay
5. Optionally, it sends you an SMS notification
6. If unlocking is disabled, the caller hears an "unavailable" message

## Callbox Setup

1. 📞 **Get a Twilio number** from [twilio.com](https://twilio.com)
2. 🏢 **Contact your property manager** and give them your Twilio number
3. ✅ **Verify** the callbox is calling your Twilio number correctly
4. 🧪 **Test** the setup by pressing your code at the callbox

> ℹ️ Some properties may charge fees or have restrictions on callbox number changes. Ask your management team for details.

- `DOOR_UNLOCK_DELAY_SECONDS`: Delay before unlocking (default is `3` seconds)
- `HANGUP_DELAY_SECONDS`: Delay before hanging up (default is `3` seconds)

## Run the Development Server 🚧

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the control panel.

## Twilio Setup 🔁

In your Twilio console:

1. Go to your Twilio phone number settings
2. Set the voice webhook URL to:

```
https://your-domain.com/api/answer
```

3. Set the HTTP method to `POST`

---

## Usage

1. ✅ Make sure your Twilio number is configured on the callbox
2. 🕹️ Use the web interface to enable auto-unlocking when needed
3. When a visitor arrives:
   - Callbox calls your Twilio number
   - Doorman answers automatically
   - If enabled, it sends unlock tones and optionally notifies you via SMS
   - If disabled, the caller hears an "unavailable" message
4. 🔒 Disable auto-unlock when you're done

The interface shows:

- Current unlock status
- Last unlock time
- Last answered call
- Last rejected attempt
